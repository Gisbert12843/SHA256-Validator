Error-Codes:

  -1  You gotta drag-drop a file onto the exe or provide it with a filepath in any other way.
  -2  You can only provide a single file to be hashed and validated
  -3  File couldn't be processed or process got interrupted. Try it again. Might also be a failure on my part.

Wanna build your own OpenSSL project and/or work with mine? Maybe got confused and frustrated with 10 different and not working versions?

    Plan ahead atleast 2-3 hours to complete everything. There might be a more convenient way, didn't find it myself yet though.
